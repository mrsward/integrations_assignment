# Integrations Interview Assignment
Hello! And welcome to my Integrations Interview Assignment Solutions. 

In this repository I go in-depth into my thought processes, design, and implementation of my solutions to the answers asked in the integration assignment. 

For my detailed answer to question 1 regarding setting a work order due date by its priority, please click [here](Set%20Due%20Date%20by%20Priority/README.md), or see folder Set Due Date By Priority/.

For my detailed answer to question 2 regarding synchronizing purchase orders between MaintainX and Coupa, please click [here](Coupa%20PO%20Sync/README.md), or see folder Coupa PO Sync/. 

I enjoyed setting up a sandbox environment and starting to learn how to use MaintainX. I had some fun with it and created everything as if we were living in the Star Wars Universe. Please see the following images sharing my environment:
