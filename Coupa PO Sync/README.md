When designing any solution, I prefer to break the larger complex problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. I created an app with the bulk of the code required for this solution to work, however I did not create an account with Coupa and was therefore unable to actually run this code. 
I hope the code that I did write provides an idea of my coding style, and how my solution might look. 
For this specific problem of synchronizing Purchase Orders (PO) from MaintainX to Coupa, I broke the problem into 7 steps. The detailed steps outlining this process are listed below:
# Synchronization of Purchase Orders (PO) from MaintainX into Coupa

## 1. Understand The Requirements
**Client Requirements**: Identifying specific client requirements such as:
- Frequency of synchronization
- Error handling and logging requirements

**Data Mappings**: Determining which fields in MaintainX correspond to which fields in Coupa, for example:

| Field in MaintainX | Field in Coupa    |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| shippingAddress    | ship-to-address    |
| updatedAt          | updated-at         |
| creatorId          | requester          |

## 2. Researching API Documentation
**Identifying key endpoints in MaintainX** such as:
- List all POs: `GET https://api.getmaintainx.com/v1/purchaseorders`
- Retrieve single PO: `GET https://api.getmaintainx.com/v1/purchaseorders/{id}`

**Identifying key endpoints in Coupa** such as:
- Authentication by retrieving a token (assuming account already set up): `POST https://{your_instance_address}/oauth2/token`
- Create PO: `POST https://{your_instance_address}/api/purchase_orders`
- Update PO: `PUT https://{your_instance_address}/api/purchase_orders/:id`
- Close PO: `PUT https://{your_instance_address}/api/purchase_orders/:id/close`
- Cancel PO: `PUT https://{your_instance_address}/api/purchase_orders/:id/cancel`

**Identifying key webhooks in MaintainX** such as:
- New Purchase Order: calls app endpoint `/po_created`
- Purchase Order Change: calls app endpoint `/po_updated`
- Purchase Order Status Change: calls app endpoint `/po_completed` or `/po_canceled`

## 3. Designing the Integration Architecture Components
- **Data Extraction**: Depending on client requirements, this can either poll POs in MaintainX at a specified interval or use an event-driven trigger from MaintainXâ€™s webhook for new PO action.
- **Data Transformation**: A service to transform the field names from a MaintainX PO to the corresponding field names in a Coupa PO.
- **Data Loading**: This component needs to call the Coupa API to create, update, close, or cancel POs using the data transformed in the previous step.
- **Logger**: Create a logger or integrate with a service such as DataDog to log whether each integration is successful or not and provide information about the status of the app.

## 4. Basic Software Flow
Assuming an app is running with endpoints the MaintainX webhooks can trigger:
- Parse webhook request for pertinent PO data and PO action
- Use defined mappings to convert MaintainX PO data into Coupa PO data
- Authenticate with the Coupa API
- Execute the action in Coupa using the Coupa API
- Log a 200 Success

## 5. Security Considerations
- Ensure secure storage and transmission of API credentials (e.g., using environment variables).
- Implement rate limiting and error handling to avoid overwhelming either API.

## 6. Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Test input and output of the components from step 3
- **Integration Tests**: Test the complete flow from MaintainX to Coupa to ensure POs are synchronized correctly

## 7. Documentation
- An overarching general technical document like this
- A software flow diagram
- A table with field mappings from MaintainX to Coupa
